# How to customize this template

In general, content can be modified by editing the **organisms** and the pages themselves. Below is a list of the most common changes that you may want to make.

## Header/site logo

* To replace the logo that appears in the header, modify or replace the contents of the `Logo.svelte` atom.

* The links that appear on the header can be modified directly in the `Header.svelte` organism.

## Hero section

* The hero section is the first section of the site's home page. It is composed of a Heading, the _intro_ text, and a list of buttons/CTAs. The contents of this section can be modified directly in the `Hero.svelte` organism.
