# How to customize this template

In general, content can be modified by editing the **organisms** and the pages themselves. Below is a list of the most common changes that you may want to make.

## Header/site logo

* To replace the logo that appears in the header, modify or replace the contents of the `Logo.svelte` atom.

* The links that appear on the header can be modified directly in the `Header.svelte` organism.
